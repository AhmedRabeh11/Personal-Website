        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-2">CEC is a competition hold by IEEE Zewail&nbsp;City that aims to
find solutions for particular challenges that occurred due to covid-19.&nbsp;Our
solution was about developing an/a App/MOBA game where schools can have a
platform to upload the teachers coursework and lectures and students would use
the same platform to attend sessions and watch lectures, the progress of
students on the sessions/coursework part would then transfer to the MOBA game
side of the app where students can be awarded for their effort by leveling up,
building kingdoms and attacking other class mates from the same school in the
game the game will functions similarly to other famous MOBA games like (LOL)
and clash of clans only difference is that progress in the game is directly
linked to the studentsâ€™ progress and achievements in his/her coursework , this
allows students to have a motivational aspect in their education where they
have something to strive and encourage them to attend online sessions in order
to rank higher on the leaderboard with respect to other students, not only will
the solution operate as a motivational tool to the students in terms of scoring
and increasing the competitiveness between students the solution will also
offer a platform for schools and educational institutes to monitor each student
individually his/her progress, attendance minutes and overall scoring on
his/her class or school. We got the 8th place out of 648 participants (140 teams)
in the CECâ€™20 by IEEE Zewail City. We are planning to continue our work to
support our community in many aspects, gain experience and leave positive
impression in people lives.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Award:</b>&nbsp;8th&nbsp;team out of 648

Engineering Fair, a program of Society for Science &amp; the Public, is the
worldâ€™s largest international pre-college science competition. Through a global
network of local, regional, and national science fairs, top students are
selected from millions, all who have demonstrated their knowledge of science
and engineering to further their understanding of the world and improve the way
we work and live. Our project aimed for removing micro-plastics from water and
reusing them for a greater good for humanity. We did this project because
microplastics harm the aquatic life directly and humans indirectly. Also,
microplastics might be collected after removal to be recycled, thus, benefit
Egypt and other countries. This will be done by taking advantage of the
photo-catalysis process that occurs naturally. The process involves the sun
degrading micro-plastics naturally into compounds of oxygen and Carbon dioxide.
Low density polyethylene type of micro-plastics uses sunlight to degrade into
lower forms. The disadvantage in this process is that it takes up to 20 years. So,
the main idea of our project is to speed up the previous process by adding a
catalyst that will make the process end in hours instead of years. Nano rods
from zinc oxide will be used. They will stick to the microplastic and absorb
more sunlight and U.V rays which will make the electrons excite and react
faster. The chosen process is non pollutant to the actual water, it does not
affect the waterâ€™s PH scale and after the effectiveness was measured, its
estimated value was about 99%.<br><b>We

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">&nbsp;<b>our project</b>&nbsp;was about providing two services, COVID-19 checker, and ordinary
symptom checker. If the COVID-19 option is chosen, a questionnaire concerning
the symptoms they are experiencing is provided. According to this
questionnaire, users are categorized into mild or severe. For mild patients, an
online video examination is held between a doctor, and accordingly, the doctor
determines necessary procedures and medications after examining the patient's
symptoms closely in the video meeting. Otherwise, considered severe, If the
patient falls under the severe category, the patient will be provided with the
available nearby COVID-19 specialized hospitals to immediately go to and a map
API will assist him/her by providing the necessary route to the health care facility. If the user chooses the
ordinary symptom checker, the user will be redirected to another page that
contains medical categories each presenting a group of body parts/part, such as
bone or nose and ears. After choosing the category, a questionnaire is provided
to be fill. If the patient is identified as mild, an online video examination
is held between the doctor for a precise diagnosis. If identified as severe, he
will be provided with the vacant hospitals nearby with its working hours and
available specializations and costs. The application has some distinctive
features, medications scheduled reminders prescribed by the doctor, a status
checker checking the patients' status, and a healing process.

                  <p class="u-text u-text-2">I had an unforgettable story with this competition; as a techy
student, I wanted to learn more about Networking and the world lying underneath
those webs, which are as rails for the information trains. I searched for
courses and books in Network+ and A+ and started walking through them. I was
digging deeper until I found the announcement of this competition on Facebook.
This competition was like a chance for me because I realized it would allow me
to evaluate myself in the network track and take preparation courses from
Huawei ICT academy. My eyes had widened in front of the announcement; without
any doubt, I decided to join it without reading the rules carefully. I took
part in the competition and took the first assessment exam. I got a high score
that qualified me for the national assessment with accomplished university
students. I was cheerful with my progression and was excited to take the
national exam. Unfortunately, I received a call from Huawei ICT Academy that
proposes the national and the international phase are for college students
only. Hence, I would not be able to complete my journey as a national finalist.
Though I was miserable on the grounds after this call, I was proud of myself
because I succeeded in passing the first stage in competition with high-quality
engineering and computer science students. As well, I gained great experience
from Huawei Networking courses and exams. From this situation, I learned that
ages are not an obstacle for you to learn advanced concepts, it is only about
your insistence about your goal. You can beat high-quality students with your
strong volition as I did. This is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FCta2GbQfd8haHuXvS4o10kjDGPl14rY/view?usp=sharing" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-1">certificate</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
