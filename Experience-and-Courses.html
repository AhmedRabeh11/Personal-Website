is a company foe game designing and development. We Grew to 20 members and
started working on our first game since we have collected our surveys from
people about their opinion and feedbacks. Form then, we continued working on
our game ending up with a trial version of “Clash of schools”. <a name="_Hlk62998779" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-link u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-black u-btn-1">Our game consists of an App/MOBA game where schools can
have a platform to upload the teachers coursework and lectures and students
would use the same platform to attend sessions and watch lectures, the progress
of students on the sessions/coursework part would then transfer to the MOBA
game side of the app where students can be awarded for their effort by leveling
up, building kingdoms and attacking other class mates from the same school in
the game the game will functions similarly to other famous MOBA games like
(LOL) and clash of clans only difference is that progress in the game is directly
linked to the students’ progress and achievements in his/her coursework , this
allows students to have a motivational aspect in their education where they
have something to strive and encourage them to attend online sessions in order
to rank higher on the leaderboard with respect to other students, not only will
the solution operate as a motivational tool to the students in terms of scoring
and increasing the competitiveness between students the solution will also
offer a platform for schools and educational institutes to monitor each student
individually his/her progress, attendance minutes and overall scoring on
his/her class or school. We got the 8th place out of 648 participants (140
teams) in the CEC’20 by IEEE Zewail City. We are planning to continue our work
to support our community in many aspects, gain experience and leave positive
impression in people lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>

Egypt, and we have to find a creative solution for it.

will always be science, engineering, and technology. And there will always,

Banach.&nbsp;Stefan Banach believed in STEM Power and stressed on the power of
the letter “M”. He believed that almost everything in our world is contributed
by Math. Because we believe the same, we established the STEM Alex Math club in
our school. We aimed to raise the awareness of the importance of Math to our
brains, life, and learning. We focused on making sessions to help new STEM
students who are passionate about Math and want to enter popular competitions
like IYMC (International Youth Math Competition), The international Math
Olympiads, MIPT Math Olympiads.&nbsp;I was a founding member of this club, also

country. It sells almost everything every home needs; it sells toys, plastic
equipment, cosmetics, perfumes, watches, and accessories for both genders:
Males and Females. I was working in the branch located in a tourist area. As a
result, I met customers from various countries and became a friend to many of
them. I was the assistant of this branch’s manager and sometimes I was working
as a cashier due to my fast calculation ability. This work raised my soft and
communication skills to a great elevation. In fact, it helped me develop my
English speaking due to talking with foreigners. Moreover, it helped me improve
my communication skills as I was a shy boy who was getting stressed while
talking to people. Furthermore, I made friends with my working companions and
we became more than brothers. One companion I am interested to share with you
is Abbas. Abbas is a distinguished electrical engineer who studied at Alexandria
University. He taught me how to fix many electrical devices and was supporting
me frequently to continue digging deeper into programming and computer science.
For example, he recommended me many courses to finish in programming, and he
invited me to attend some programming conferences and orientations in his
University. He was encouraging me by saying that I am a smart, good leader and
can handle big projects/problems with my potential. I really appreciate his
words and all his encouragement. Nowadays, I am applying his biggest advice: Do
your best to study in the USA.</p>

at the 2003 squad at Alexandria for petroleum club. Before getting into A.P.C,
I was playing in an unpopular soccer academy called “Abu-Yusif Academy.” I was
trained well and considered as one of the best players in this academy. Once,
“Abu-Yusif Academy” organized a match with A.P.C. In that match, I was doing
well, and I showed high dribbling skills. After the match had ended, A.P.C
contacted my coach to get into their squad. A.P.C was renowned for its
exceptional players and good results in their matches with the other clubs in
Egypt. Without any hesitation, I got into A.P.C, after my coach has advised me
to stick to this chance. I showed excellence in the 2003 squad in A.P.C until I
succeeded to get into the 2002, 2001, and 1999 teams in the same club. I gained
great experience and received many awards and medals for joining various
tournaments.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
